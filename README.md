# linprog_curvefit
Curve fitting with linear programming.

## How it works
This algorithm attempts to minimize the error for a chosen set of polynomials.
Error is calculated in a variety of ways for comparison.

Input:
- Points to fit
- (optional) Best fit curve as calculated by equivalent closed form formula.
